If you are getting that message, try un-installing the
webapp you last installed. Doing this might get rid of
the error. If it is still there, keep uninstalling and
reinstalling the apps until you find the culprit.

If it is still happening, you need to go into the registry
and delete these keys:
HKEY CURRENT USER\SOFTWARE\Olive OS Web Edition\WebApps
Edit1
Edit2
Edit3
Edit4
Edit5
and
site1
site2
site3
site4
site5

That should get rid of all the issues that have been caused by the
script error.
