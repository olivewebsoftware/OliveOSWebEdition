If updates are not downloading, try this:

1) Run Olive OS as an administrator

If that doesn't work, try this:

Go to Program Files\Olive OS Web Edition

Look for "Updates.exe'

If it is there, run it and click "Yes" at the 
prompt. If it is not, try running Olive OS as
an administrator.

If none of these steps are working, Olive OS may be

A) Corrupted
B) Infected with Malware
C) Having a user error

If Olive OS is still not doing updates after being run
as an administrator, try re-installing it.

Go to OliveWeb's website and download Olive OS Web Edition.

(olivewebsoftware.github.io/oliveweb/index11.html)

Run the installer, click "Yes", and then wait for it to install.

After re-installation, try updating again. (Run it as administrator).

If it still fails, Olive OS could be infected with malware.

How to get rid of malware:

1) Run a scan on OliveWeb Security
2) Check for running tasks in Task Manager that look strange.
3) Remove all webapps.
4) Last resort: Factory reset. Settings>About and Update>Factory Reset
