Olive OS is acting slow:

If this happens, you may need to refresh the copy.
Go to: 
Settings\About and Update\Refresh This Copy

If it is still being slow, your PC may be on the lower end
of hardware, or you need to run System Repair:

Settings\About and Update\System Recovery\Advanced Options\Run System Repair

Wait a few minutes. When it is done, check if it is acting slow again.
If it is still acting slow, your PC may be on the lower end.

Olive OS is not starting, bootlooping, or going to random screens:

If this happens, the copy is corrupted and needs to be re-installed.
1) Go to olivewebsoftware.github.io/oliveweb/index11.html
2) Download the file
3) Run the file and click "Yes" at the prompt
4) Let it install

If Olive OS starts, you are complete!
If Olive OS goes to a system repair window, let it run.
If Olive OS goes to a "update failure" window, choose one of the options.
If Olive OS still doesn't start, contact OliveWeb at kk.online@mail.com

If Olive OS is acting funny, run system repair and that should fix it.
